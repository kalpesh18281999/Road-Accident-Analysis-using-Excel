🚗 Road Accident Analysis Project Completed! 🚗


🔍 Project Overview:
The aim was to create a detailed Road Accident Dashboard to help stakeholders understand key metrics and trends related to road accidents. Here are some of the key insights and features of the dashboard:

🔹Primary KPIs:

Total Casualties after accidents,
Total Casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by vehicle type

🔹Secondary KPIs:
Total Casualties by vehicle type,
Monthly trend comparison of casualties for the Current Year and Previous Year,
Maximum casualties by Road Type,
Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface,
Relationship between Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night

🔧 Tools Used:
Excel for data analysis and visualization,
Lookup functions to efficiently retrieve data,
Pivot Tables and Charts for dynamic data representation,
Conditional Formatting for highlighting key metrics,

📊 Key Findings:
A significant percentage of accidents occurred at night,
Urban areas saw a higher number of accidents compared to rural areas,
Two-wheeler vehicles were involved in the majority of severe accidents,
This project has further honed my skills in data analysis and visualization, and I'm eager to apply these insights to drive better road safety measures.
